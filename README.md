Over the next few months, I will be uploading conf files and little scripts and projects I'm working on. Mostly just candy and small dev stuff while I get my Linux+ CompTIA certs among others. Also a basic desktop setup so I don't have to keep re-doing it every time I do a fresh install cause I'm lazy. Will also be tinkering with server setups later on so that'll be fun
